## Long short-term memory

- [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory): Long 
short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural
network (RNN) architecture[1] used in the field of deep
learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM
has feedback connections that make it a "general purpose
computer" (that is, it can compute anything that a Turing
machine can)[2]. It can not only process single data points
(such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as
speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks
such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition[3] or
speech recognition.[4][5] Bloomberg Business Week wrote: "These
powers make LSTM arguably the most commercial AI achievement,
used for everything from predicting diseases to composing music."
