- [Data2Vis: Automatic Generation of Data
Visualizations Using Sequence to Sequence Recurrent Neural
Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03126) by Victor Dibia,
Çağatay Demiralp. In this paper we introduce Data2Vis,
a neural translation model for automatically generating
visualizations from given datasets. We formulate visualization
generation as a sequence to sequence translation problem where
data specifications are mapped to visualization specifications
in a declarative language (Vega-Lite). To this end, we train a
multilayered attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) with
long short-term memory (LSTM) units on a corpus of visualization
specifications.
