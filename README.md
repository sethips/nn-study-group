## Papers
- [Data2Vis: Automatic Generation of Data Visualizations Using Sequence to Sequence Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03126) by Victor Dibia, Çağatay Demiralp. In this paper we introduce Data2Vis, a neural translation model for automatically generating visualizations from given datasets. We formulate visualization generation as a sequence to sequence translation problem where data specifications are mapped to visualization specifications in a declarative language (Vega-Lite). To this end, we train a multilayered attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units on a corpus of visualization specifications.

## CNN
- [human-activity-recognition-cnn](https://aqibsaeed.github.io/2016-11-04-human-activity-recognition-cnn/)  One such application is human activity recognition (HAR) using data collected from smartphone’s accelerometer. There are several techniques proposed in the literature for HAR using machine learning.

  - [Human Activity Recognition](https://github.com/healthDataScience/deep-learning-HAR) In this part of the repo, we discuss the human activity recognition problem using deep learning algorithms and compare the results with standard machine learning algorithms that use engineered features.
